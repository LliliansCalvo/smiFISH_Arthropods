All tutorials needed to find neighbour and convert neighbours IDs to mRNA content used in the paper are provided here. 

Neighbours finding can be done using two methods:
- Polygons build from the membrane staning 
- Eucledian distance calculated using a user defined distance from each center point (cell)

In order to follow the tutorial the users can download our provided (test) raw data in the Raw_data/ folder. 
The results of the script are also provided in the folder Results/ for comparaison. 

For more details about the different methods see publication
